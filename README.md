# Plusminus

A beginner project in C89 from the first chapter of the C track by [Openclassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/) (aka Le site du z√©ro). You may find it [here](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/19980-apprenez-a-programmer-en-c/14828-tp-plus-ou-moins-votre-premier-jeu) and [here](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/19980-apprenez-a-programmer-en-c/6760501-entrainez-vous-a-ameliorer-le-jeu-du-plus-ou-moins) (in French).

Clone this repository and use the command `$ make` to create the executable `plusminus`.

Play the game by using the command `$ ./plusminus`.

### Rules

At some point I guess, right now I can't be bothered.
